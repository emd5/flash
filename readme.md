## Project Description
Flash is a tool that helps you prepare for a test, an interview, or anything that you need to memorize. Create digital flash cards for all your study needs.

## Problem Domain
As junior developers in a learning environment, we thought it would be helpful to have a tool to learn about the different Amazon Web Services (AWS) products. Since there are more than 90 AWS products, we thought flash cards might be a useful and familiar way to approach learning them.

As we began thinking through the problem more thoroughly we realized digital flash cards could be used to study lots of information, not just AWS products.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see a homepage, so that I can see an "AWS Quiz" and "Make Your Own" button.

- As a user, I want to see a navigation bar on the homepage, so that I can click on the different pages on the website.

- As a user, I want to see a preloading quiz page, so that I can see a flashcard with a question displayed.

- As a user, on the quiz page I want to be able to click on the question, so that the card flips to see the answer.

- As a user, I want to see a back and next arrow button, so that I can see all cards through the deck.

- As a user, on the quiz page I want to have an option to review the entire deck of cards, so that I can go through the flashcards again.

- As a user, on completion of the quiz page, I want to have an option to review incorrect cards, so that I know what I can improve. 

- As a user, on completion of the quiz page, I want to navigate to the home page, so that I can go back to the home page.

- As a user, I want to see a question/answer input section on the form page, so that I can create my own deck.

- As a user, I want to see on the form page, a make card button, so that I can save my question/answer from the form.

- As a user, I want to be able to have the option to change card color and font, so that I can customize the design to my liking.

- As a user, I want to export my deck, so that I can save my custom flashcards for later use.
