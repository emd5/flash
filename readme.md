## Project Description
Flash is a tool that helps you prepare for a test, an interview, or anything that you need to memorize. Create digital flash cards for all your study needs.

## Problem Domain
As junior developers in a learning environment, we thought it would be helpful to have a tool to learn about the different Amazon Web Services (AWS) products. Since there are more than 90 AWS products, we thought flash cards might be a useful and familiar way to approach learning them.

As we began thinking through the problem more thoroughly we realized digital flash cards could be used to study lots of information, not just AWS products.
